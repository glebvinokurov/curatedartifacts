# Curatorial Statement

The study of Russian women writers faces some significant challenges, which lie not only in the general lack of its representation within the Russian literary studies, but also in its relative isolation from similar research projects discussing the early women writers in Europe and North America. It is indeed true that professional women writing was not as common in Russia in the 18-19 century as it was in the West, nor did the works of Russian women writers have an impact as large as that of their Western counterparts (until the late 19 century). That being said, the Russian Empire was by no means isolated from the West and its literary discourse, therefore certain parallels and intertextual relationships can be discovered and described. 
In this selection, the first two artefacts are chosen from the collection of abstracts from the *Digital Humanities 2017* conference, and the third artifact is a tool discovered through TAPoR 3.0. The selected artifacts can not only facilitate searching the connections with foreign writers and drawing analogies, but also serve as models for possible similar projects tailored to Russian women writers.

## Intertextual Networks: Theorizing and Encoding Textual Connections in Early Women’s Writing

Intertextual Networks, introduced by the Women Writers Project, is aimed at, according to this abstract, “exploring and theorizing the representation of intertextuality.” Perusing their digital collection (Women Writers Online), they look to discover the traces of other texts emerging in women’s writing (textual reverberation) and make them legible “within the new digital systems of textual circulation”.  
In order to build a larger digital intertextuality, the WWP needs to coordinate they work with two other major resources, the Collective Biographies of Women and RECIRC. How this can be done and what the result could like is discussed in this article.  

## Digital Representation, Intertextual Relationships, and the Impact of Early Modern Women’s Writing

The RECIRC project (The Reception and Circulation of Early Modern Women’s Writing, 1550– 1700; funded by the European Research Council (2014–2019) and led by Marie-Louise Coolahan) is aimed at studying intellectual impact and answer questions concerning who read women writers, where, when, and who of them were read.  RECIRC is structured around four interlinking ‘work packages’ (Catholic religious orders; scientific correspondence; early modern manuscripts; early modern library archives).
The project is mainly concerned with developing taxonomies of reception and circulation (collaboration with WWP and the Collective Biographies of Women project).  According to the abstract, the aim of the project is to create network visualizations and analyses that embrace both the gendering of reception and the relationships of texts with each other.
